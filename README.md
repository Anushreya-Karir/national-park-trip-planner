# national-park-trip-planner

Copyright 2022 Anushreya Karir

This project is a website built using Flask, National Park Service API, OpenWeather API, and AirVisual API.
It is a simple website that allows users to search for a national park and see related information as well as forecasts for the next few days at that park so the user can plan a trip to the national park.

# Running this app

To run this application on Flask, you need three API keys (one for National Park Service API, AirVisualAPI and OpenWeather API).
The three API keys should be stored in a file called api_keys.py in the variables NPS_API_KEY, AQI_API_KEY, and OPW_API_KEY respectively.
